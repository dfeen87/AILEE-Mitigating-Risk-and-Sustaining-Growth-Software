# AILLE Metrics Extension – Operational Playbook
## Interpreting Metrics and Responding Safely

---

## Purpose

This document provides **operational guidance** for interpreting metrics generated by the **AILLE Metrics Extension** and outlines **appropriate response actions** in live or simulated environments.

It is intended for:
- Quantitative researchers
- Risk managers
- SRE / infrastructure teams
- On-call engineers supporting algorithmic systems

This playbook focuses on **observation and diagnosis**, not automated intervention.

---

## Design Philosophy

AILLE metrics are designed to:
- Surface early warning signals
- Support human decision-making
- Avoid overreaction to short-term noise

**Metrics inform judgment — they do not override it.**

---

## Establishing a Baseline

Before acting on any metric:

1. Run AILLE with metrics enabled for **1–2 weeks**
2. Record baseline values under:
   - normal market conditions
   - known volatile periods
3. Establish strategy-specific norms

No thresholds are universal.  
Baseline behavior is the reference point.

## Key Metrics and How to Interpret Them

### 1. Fallback Activation Rate

**What it measures:**  
The fraction of decisions where AILLE activated its fallback mechanism.

**Typical meaning:**
- Low (0–5%): Normal operation
- Moderate (5–10%): Increased uncertainty
- High (>10%): Potential model disagreement or regime change

**Common causes:**
- Reduced model confidence
- Sudden volatility
- Signal degradation

**Recommended actions:**
- Review model inputs
- Check confidence distributions
- Validate market data quality

**Do NOT:**
- Disable fallback
- Immediately halt trading without corroborating signals

---

### 2. Consensus Failure Rate

**What it measures:**  
Frequency at which models fail to agree directionally.

**Typical meaning:**
- Stable: Models are aligned
- Rising: Diverging model views
- Sustained high: Strategy assumptions may no longer hold

**Recommended actions:**
- Inspect model correlations
- Check for regime shifts
- Evaluate whether models are reacting to different signals

---

### 3. Average Confidence Trend

**What it measures:**  
Mean confidence across all accepted decisions.

**Important pattern:**  
A **gradual decline** is often more informative than a sharp drop.

**Recommended actions:**
- Investigate feature drift
- Examine confidence calibration
- Compare with historical regimes

---

### 4. Confidence Distribution (Min / Max / StdDev)

**Why it matters:**
- Narrow distribution → stable environment
- Wide distribution → mixed signal quality

**High variance** may indicate:
- Model instability
- Partial data outages
- Overfitting to specific conditions

---

### 5. Models Agreed Histogram

**What it shows:**  
How often decisions are made with 2, 3, 4+ agreeing models.

**Interpretation:**
- Higher agreement = stronger ensemble confidence
- Persistent low agreement = reduced ensemble robustness

---

### 6. Invalid Input Count

**What it indicates:**
- NaN / Inf confidence values
- Invalid timestamps
- Corrupted decision objects

**Action required:**
- Yes. Always investigate.
- This points to upstream issues, not AILLE logic.

---

## Operational Response Guidelines

### When to Investigate (Recommended)

- Fallback rate exceeds baseline for multiple sessions
- Consensus failures spike suddenly
- Confidence metrics degrade steadily
- Invalid inputs appear

### When NOT to React Immediately

- Single-session spikes
- Short-lived volatility events
- Known macro announcements
- One-off data glitches already identified

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Principle

AILLE metrics are **diagnostic tools**, not trading signals.

Best practice:
- Metrics → diagnosis
- Diagnosis → human judgment
- Judgment → controlled system changes

---

## Integration with Existing Monitoring

AILLE metrics can be:
- Logged periodically
- Exported to dashboards
- Used for alerting thresholds

They are complementary to:
- PnL monitoring
- Latency metrics
- Infrastructure health checks

---

## Summary

AILLE metrics help teams:
- Detect degradation early
- Understand model behavior
- Maintain operational discipline

Used correctly, they improve **confidence, stability, and trust** in algorithmic systems.

Used incorrectly, they can cause overreaction.

This playbook exists to keep the response **measured, informed, and professional**.
