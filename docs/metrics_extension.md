# AILLE Metrics Extension

**Real-Time Observability for Algorithmic Decision Integrity**

## Overview

The AILLE Metrics Extension provides a read-only, production-safe observability layer for monitoring how AILLE decisions behave in real time.

It is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing algorithmic trading or decision-execution systems **without modifying AILLE core logic**.

This extension enables teams to measure, monitor, and alert on decision quality, fallback behavior, and confidence trends while preserving determinism and auditability.

---

## Design Principles

- **Read-only**: Metrics never influence decisions
- **Non-intrusive**: No hooks or callbacks inside AILLE core
- **Thread-safe**: Safe for multi-threaded execution environments
- **Bounded memory**: No unbounded growth or leaks
- **Regulator-friendly**: Observability without behavioral coupling

> **Note**: The AILLE core remains v1-stable. This extension represents v2 observability, not a logic change.

---

## Repository Placement

Recommended structure:

```
extensions/
  aille_metrics.hpp
docs/
  metrics_extension.md
```

No changes to existing core files are required.

---

## Integration Pattern (Recommended)

### 1. Include the Metrics Extension

```cpp
#include "aille.hpp"
#include "extensions/aille_metrics.hpp"
```

### 2. Instantiate Engine and Metrics Collector

```cpp
AILLE::AILLEEngine engine;
AILLE::MetricsCollector metrics;
```

The metrics collector is independent of the engine and can be owned by:
- the trading loop
- a strategy controller
- a monitoring subsystem

### 3. Observe Decisions in the Execution Path

After each AILLE decision:

```cpp
AILLE::Decision decision = engine.makeDecision(signals);

// Observe (read-only)
metrics.observeDecision(decision);

// Execute based on decision
if (decision.status == AILLE::DECISION_VALID) {
    execute_trade(decision.final_value);
} else if (decision.fallback_used) {
    execute_trade(decision.final_value);  // conservative
} else {
    skip_trade();
}
```

**Important**: Metrics collection occurs **after** decision-making and does not affect execution.

---

## Metrics Collected

The extension tracks the following operational metrics:

### Decision Counts

- Total decisions
- Valid decisions
- Fallback activations
- Rejected (low confidence)
- Rejected (no consensus)
- Invalid inputs

### Rates

- Fallback activation rate
- Consensus failure rate

These are critical indicators for:
- model divergence
- regime shifts
- degraded signal quality

### Confidence Statistics

- Average confidence
- Minimum confidence
- Maximum confidence
- Standard deviation of confidence

**Confidence trends often surface issues before PnL impact.**

### Agreement Distribution

- Histogram of `models_agreed`

Useful for diagnosing:
- model redundancy
- over-correlation
- ensemble collapse

### Health Signals

- Counter overflow detection
- Input validation failures
- Last decision timestamp

---

## Retrieving Metrics

### Snapshot Retrieval (Thread-Safe)

```cpp
AILLE::MetricsSnapshot snapshot = metrics.getSnapshot();
```

This returns a copy of the current metrics state and is safe to call from:
- monitoring threads
- logging pipelines
- dashboards

### Human-Readable Summary (Optional)

```cpp
std::cout << AILLE::formatMetrics(snapshot);
```

Useful for:
- debugging
- logs
- on-call diagnostics

---

## Health Checks & Alerting

A simple built-in health check is provided:

```cpp
if (!metrics.isHealthy(0.10f)) {
    alert("AILLE fallback rate exceeded threshold");
}
```

### Recommended Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Typical Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|
| Fallback Rate | > 5–10% |
| Consensus Failure Rate | > 15% |
| Avg Confidence Drop | Sustained decline |
| Invalid Inputs | > 0 |

**Thresholds should be tuned to strategy and regime.**

---

## Resetting Metrics (Optional)

For testing or controlled evaluation windows:

```cpp
metrics.reset();
```

This does **not** affect AILLE behavior or audit logs.

---

## Threading Model

- All metrics operations are internally synchronized
- Safe for concurrent decision streams
- Snapshot reads do not block decision execution

The extension is suitable for:
- HFT
- multi-strategy engines
- distributed execution nodes

---

## Relationship to Audit Logging

| Audit Layer | Metrics Extension |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Compliance & traceability | Operational observability |
| Tamper-evident | Real-time |
| Persistent | In-memory |
| Regulatory reporting | Monitoring & alerting |

**Both layers are complementary and can be used together.**

---

## What This Extension Does NOT Do

❌ Modify decisions  
❌ Adjust thresholds  
❌ Perform model evaluation  
❌ Replace audit logging  
❌ Introduce external dependencies  

**It is observational only by design.**

---

## Deployment Guidance

Recommended rollout:

1. Enable metrics in parallel with existing monitoring
2. Observe baseline behavior (1–2 weeks)
3. Establish alert thresholds
4. Integrate with dashboards (Grafana, logs, etc.)
5. Use trends for model diagnostics — **not** execution overrides

---

## Versioning & Stability

- **AILLE Core**: v1.x (stable, unchanged)
- **Metrics Extension**: v2.0 (this document)

Future versions may add:
- JSON export
- Prometheus endpoints
- Time-windowed aggregations

**Core decision logic will remain unchanged.**

---

## Summary

The AILLE Metrics Extension provides **visibility without interference**.

It allows teams to:
- ✅ trust the system
- ✅ verify behavior
- ✅ detect degradation early
- ✅ satisfy operational oversight requirements

All while preserving the stability and integrity of the AILLE core.
